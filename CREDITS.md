## AIChat
Loki originally started as a fork of the fantastic
[AIChat CLI](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat). The initial goal was simply
to fix a bug in how MCP servers worked with AIChat, allowing different MCP
servers to be specified per agent. Since then, Loki has evolved far beyond
its original scope and grown into a passion project with a life of its own.

Today, Loki includes first-class MCP server support (for both local and remote
servers), a built-in vault for interpolating secrets in configuration files,
built-in agents and macros, dynamic tab completions, integrated custom
functions (no external `argc` dependency), improved documentation, and much
more with many more ideas planned for the future.

Loki is now developed and maintained as an independent project. Full credit
for the original foundation goes to the developers of the wonderful
AIChat project.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the AIChat maintainers.

## AIChat

Loki originally began as a fork of [AIChat CLI](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat),
created and maintained by the AIChat contributors.

While Loki has since diverged significantly and is now developed as an
independent project, its early foundation and inspiration came from the
AIChat project.
