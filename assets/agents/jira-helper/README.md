# Jira AI Agent

## Overview

The Jira AI Agent is designed to assist with managing tasks within Jira projects, providing capabilities such as 
creating, searching, updating, assigning, linking, and commenting on issues. Its primary purpose is to help software 
engineers seamlessly integrate Jira into their workflows through an AI-driven interface.

## Configuration
This agent uses the official [Atlassian MCP Server](https://github.com/atlassian/atlassian-mcp-server). To use it, 
ensure you have Node.js v18+ installed to run the local MCP proxy (`mcp-remote`).

The server uses OAuth 2.0 so it will automatically open your browser for you to sign in to your account. No manual 
configuration is necessary!
