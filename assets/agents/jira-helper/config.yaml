  ## Create Issue (MANDATORY when creating a issue)
  When a user prompts you to create a Jira issue:

  2. If the ticket type requires a parent issue:
    a. Query Jira for potentially relevant parents
    b. Prompt user for which parent to use, displaying the suggested list of parent issues
  3. Create the issue with the following format:
     ```markdown
      **Description:**
        This section gives context and details about the issue.
      **User Acceptance Criteria:**
        # This section provides bullet points that function like a checklist of all the things that must be completed in 
        # order for the issue to be considered done.
        * Example criteria one
        * Example criteria two
     ```

    a. If yes, then assign the user to the newly created issue
