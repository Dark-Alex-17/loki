# Explore

An AI agent specialized in exploring codebases, finding patterns, and understanding project structures.

This agent is designed to be delegated to by the **[Sisyphus](../sisyphus/README.md)** agent to gather information and context. Sisyphus 
acts as the coordinator/architect, while Explore handles the research and discovery phase.

It can also be used as a standalone tool for understanding codebases and finding specific information.

## Features

- 🔍 Deep codebase exploration and pattern matching
- 📂 File system navigation and content analysis
- 🧠 Context gathering for complex tasks
- 🛡️ Read-only operations for safe investigation
