# Oracle

An AI agent specialized in high-level architecture, complex debugging, and design decisions.

This agent is designed to be delegated to by the **[Sisyphus](../sisyphus/README.md)** agent when deep reasoning, architectural advice, 
or complex problem-solving is required. Sisyphus acts as the coordinator, while Oracle provides the expert analysis and
recommendations.

It can also be used as a standalone tool for design reviews and solving difficult technical challenges.

## Features

- 🏛️ System architecture and design patterns
- 🐛 Complex debugging and root cause analysis
- ⚖️ Tradeoff analysis and technology selection
- 📝 Code review and best practices advice
- 🧠 Deep reasoning for ambiguous problems
