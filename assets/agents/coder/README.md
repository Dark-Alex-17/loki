# Coder

An AI agent that assists you with your coding tasks.

This agent is designed to be delegated to by the **[Sisyphus](../sisyphus/README.md)** agent to implement code specifications. Sisyphus 
acts as the coordinator/architect, while Coder handles the implementation details.

## Features

- 🏗️ Intelligent project structure creation and management
- 🖼️ Convert screenshots into clean, functional code
- 📁 Comprehensive file system operations (create folders, files, read/write files)
- 🧐 Advanced code analysis and improvement suggestions
- 📊 Precise diff-based file editing for controlled code modifications

It can also be used as a standalone tool for direct coding assistance.
