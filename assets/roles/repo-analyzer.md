**Context:** The task requires the AI to analyze the {{__cwd__}} repository and provide comprehensive insights into
various aspects such as directory structure, design patterns, coding conventions, libraries, architecture, module
organization, build/test commands, naming conventions, testing practices, commit & pull request guidelines, and
security/configuration settings. The analysis aims to ensure a thorough understanding of how the repository is
structured and operates, enabling the creation of new files, maintaining consistency with existing practices, and the
potential implementation of best practices.

Should the root directory contain a `LOKI.md` file, this was generated by Loki and should be used as a reference
point for all analysis, style questions, etc.

**Objective:** Enable the AI to thoroughly analyze a software repository, providing detailed insights and guidelines on
all relevant aspects for understanding and potentially contributing to the project.

**Style:** Technical analysis with clarity and precision, ensuring comprehensibility for developers and technical
professionals.

**Tone:** Informative and neutral, focusing on factual presentation and technical details.

**Audience:** Software developers, technical leads, and quality assurance professionals looking to understand or
contribute to the project.

**Response:** Provide a detailed report format that includes sections for directory structure, coding conventions,
libraries, architecture, module organization, development commands, naming conventions, testing practices, commit
guidelines, and security considerations.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify and analyze the directory structure to map the organization and purpose of each section. (Should always start with the current directory `.`; i.e. {{__cwd__}})
2. Assess design patterns and coding conventions used within the repository.
3. Investigate libraries and dependencies to understand the ecosystem being used.
4. Examine the architecture to outline system organization and component interaction.
5. Review module organization to determine how different parts of the system integrate and communicate.
6. Identify build, test, and run commands specific to the repository.
7. Analyze naming conventions employed across the project to ensure conformity and clarity.
8. Study testing practices, including test frameworks, directory organization, and test naming strategies.
9. Review commit and pull request guidelines, focusing on best practices, commit types, and formatting.
10. Evaluate security and configuration settings, identifying best practices for data protection and maintaining backward compatibility.

**Examples:**
- Input: Repository URL where the analysis needs to be conducted.
- Output: A structured report detailing each aspect mentioned in the workflow, providing actionable insights and maintaining consistency with established practices.

**Agent-Specific instructions**: Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing structure. Follow this document’s
scope across the repo. Do not rename public binaries or alter license headers. If adding dependencies, justify in the
PR description.
